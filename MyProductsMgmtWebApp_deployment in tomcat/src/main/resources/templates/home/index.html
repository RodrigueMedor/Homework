            To browse and manage the <a href="product/list">shopping of product</a>, please first make sure to read the
            instructions and key points provided below. And then click the
            appropriate menu item, located on the menu-bar above.<br/><br/>

            Simply we can divide consumer products in convenience, speciality, unsought and shopping products.  Consumer buying behavior is an important determinant to classify a particular product in the market. Marketers classify a product based on the behavioral differences of the consumers. Keep in mind that this classification is not based on product but on consumer behavior.
